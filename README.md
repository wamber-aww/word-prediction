# Introduction

This project is a simple attempt to use natural language processing to build a word prediction app in Shiny. This is an extention of the 
[Coursera Data Science Specialization Capstone Project](https://github.com/wamber-aww/coursera-data-science/tree/gh-pages/Course10_Capstone),
with more exploratory data analysis, modeling, and predicton.
